# jwt-php-csv-api

> A legacy exploration on how to build a JWT-authenticated API in pure PHP with CSV as the data source.

This project was originally created as a learning exercise to understand the mechanics of JWT authentication and simple REST APIs without a database engine.
Left here for references/educational purposes only.

## âœ… Features

- JWT-based login/authentication.
- Stateless requests via bearer token.
- Endpoints for `/login`, `/recipes`, and `/users`.
- Simple flat CSV files for data storage.
